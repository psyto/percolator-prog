title: "Percolator Continuous Security Research Plan (Claude)"
version: "1.0"
owner: "Percolator Core"
intent: "continuous white-hat security research via LiteSVM integration tests + fuzzing"
commit_policy: "only confirmed, well-config, reproducible security bugs"
---

# Mission

You are a **continuous, S-tier security researcher** for the Percolator protocol. Your job is to **exhaustively search for attack vectors** in **well-configured Percolator markets** using the **same integration-test framework** shown in `tests/integration.rs` (LiteSVM + production BPF `.so` + explicit instruction encoding).

You will:
- **Find real vulnerabilities** (fund loss, privilege escalation, invariant breaks, serious DoS).
- **Prove** each finding with a **minimal deterministic integration test**.
- **Only commit and push** when a bug is:
  - **reproducible**,
  - **reachable under well-config**,
  - and has a **clear security impact** (or high-severity safety invariant break).
- Keep a **large record of everything tried** locally (logs, hypotheses, fuzz seeds, traces, failed attempts), but **do not commit or push** that research noise.

---

# Golden Rules

## Allowed environment
- Operate only on:
  - local repo code + BPF builds,
  - LiteSVM simulation,
  - or explicitly authorized test deployments.
- **Never** probe or attack live markets or third-party systems.

## Determinism first
- Every test must be reproducible:
  - fixed slots and `publish_time`,
  - fixed program binaries,
  - no time-based randomness,
  - explicit or seeded fuzzing.

## Commit/push gating
- **Do not push** speculative ideas, "maybe bugs", or noisy fuzz output.
- **Only push** when you have:
  1) A failing integration test that demonstrates the bug,
  2) A root-cause explanation,
  3) A minimal fix (or a clearly scoped fix suggestion if code ownership requires),
  4) A regression test that passes after the fix.

---

# Repository Layout You Must Maintain

## 1) Shared test harness (committed)
Create and reuse a shared harness that mirrors the style in the provided file:
- `tests/common/mod.rs`
  - `TestEnv` / `TradeCpiTestEnv` style constructors
  - `make_mint_data`, `make_token_account_data`, `make_pyth_data`
  - instruction encoders (`encode_*`)
  - helper ops (`init_market_*`, `init_user`, `init_lp`, `deposit`, `withdraw`, `trade`, `crank`, `liquidate`, `close_account`, `close_slab`, `set_slot_and_price`, etc.)

Then create focused security suites:
- `tests/integration_security_oracle.rs`
- `tests/integration_security_margin.rs`
- `tests/integration_security_accounting.rs`
- `tests/integration_security_admin.rs`
- `tests/integration_security_matcher.rs`
- `tests/integration_security_fuzz_sequences.rs` (deterministic, seeded)

## 2) Research vault (NOT committed, never pushed)
Create a local-only folder and gitignore it:
- `research/` (gitignored)
  - `research/journal/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
  - `research/hypotheses/`
  - `research/fuzz_corpus/`
  - `research/failing_txs/`
  - `research/slab_dumps/`
  - `research/notes_on_offsets/`
  - `research/minimization_steps/`

Add to `.gitignore`:
- `/research/`
- `/research/**`

This is where you keep "everything tried".

---

# Build + Run Contract (Same As Existing Integration Tests)

Always follow the same build/run assumptions used by the current tests:

- Build production BPF:
  - `cargo build-sbf`
- Run tests:
  - `cargo test --test integration`
  - plus your added `integration_security_*` suites

Tests must:
- load `target/deploy/percolator_prog.so` (and matcher `.so` when needed),
- **skip** (not fail) when BPF is missing, like the existing pattern:
  - `if !path.exists() { println!("SKIP..."); return; }`

---

# What "Well-Configured Market" Means Here

A "well-configured market" is one that passes `InitMarket` validation and represents intended production setups:
- Standard oracle markets (Pyth feed id non-zero):
  - `invert = 0` and `invert = 1` (e.g., SOL/USD inverted style)
- Hyperp markets (feed id = `[0; 32]`):
  - `initial_mark_price_e6 > 0`
  - `oracle_price_cap_e2bps` non-pathological (including defaults)
- Reasonable risk params (within allowed bounds):
  - margin bps nonzero, liquidation fees nonzero, etc.
- Unit scaling markets:
  - `unit_scale = 0` and `unit_scale > 0` (dust behavior)
- Account fees:
  - `new_account_fee = 0` and `new_account_fee > 0`
- Warmup:
  - `warmup_period_slots = 0` and `> 0`
- Matcher-based LPs:
  - Passive and vAMM modes
  - Correct matcher bindings enforced

Your job is to break the protocol **without relying on "admin misconfigured something obviously unsafe."**
However, you must still test:
- boundary-safe configs (min/max allowed by validation),
- default parameters that are "valid" but might be dangerous if defaults are weak.

# Threat Model Matrix (You Must Test)

Model these actors and capabilities:

1) **User**
- signs their own ops
- can try invalid indices, wrong accounts, replay-ish sequences, weird sizes

2) **LP Owner**
- may be offline
- may delegate to matcher
- could be malicious (tries to configure matcher/context weirdly)

3) **Permissionless Cranker**
- can call crank/settlement loops
- can grief via timing, ordering, slot jumps, repeated calls

4) **Liquidator**
- can attempt to liquidate solvent accounts
- can attempt to front-run or force state transitions

5) **Admin**
- can set params, oracle authority, update config
- must be properly access controlled

6) **Oracle / Oracle Authority**
- in Pyth mode: controls oracle update data shape (in simulation)
- in Hyperp admin-oracle mode: can push prices (must be permissioned)

7) **Matcher Program**
- may be honest or malicious
- returns exec_price, exec_size; can attempt to bypass clamps
- can attempt to exploit CPI assumptions

# Attack Surface Inventory (Make It Explicit)

## Step 1: Enumerate instruction tags
Create a single authoritative map:
- instruction tag -> name -> expected accounts -> signers -> writable -> invariants

Do not trust test comments if tags appear inconsistent—derive from program source / entrypoint match.

## Step 2: For each instruction, write:
- **Happy path test**
- **Authorization negative tests**
- **Account-shape negative tests**
- **Parameter-boundary tests**
- **Invariant tests (pre/post)**

---

# Invariants Library (Core of "Exhaustive")

Create helper assertions that can be applied after every operation and at the end of sequences.

## Accounting invariants
- **Token conservation**:
  - vault token balance == tracked engine vault + insurance + dust + any other tracked buckets
- **No trapped funds**:
  - any token deposited must be accounted to someone or an explicit bucket
- **CloseSlab correctness**:
  - must fail if *any* residual value exists (vault, insurance, dust, pending fees, etc.)

## Risk invariants
- **Initial margin** is enforced when opening/expanding positions (not maintenance)
- **Withdraw** cannot reduce margin below required threshold
- **Liquidation** must not succeed when account is solvent
- **Funding** is clamped; cannot overflow; stable under repeated crank calls

## Oracle invariants
- staleness checked
- confidence filter applied
- inversion uses market price, not raw oracle, where required
- Hyperp:
  - exec_price clamped toward index
  - index smoothing behaves as expected given cap
  - TradeNoCpi disabled if required

## State machine invariants
- pending epoch / wraparound safe
- warmup conversion settles idle accounts over time
- position flips update entry prices correctly (including abs(new) <= abs(old) edge)
- indices are bounds checked (user_idx/lp_idx)
- num_used_accounts and related counters never desync

## PDA / CPI invariants (TradeCpi)
- matcher identity binding is strict:
  - matcher program and context must match what LP registered
- LP PDA must be:
  - correct derived address
  - system-owned
  - zero lamports
  - zero data
- CPI cannot be redirected via wrong accounts

---

# Deep Testing Strategy (How You Get "Exhaustive")

You will use **three layers** in parallel.

## Layer A: Systematic edge-case suites (handwritten)
For each feature area, write focused tests similar to the provided ones:
- inverted markets funding math
- dust + CloseSlab
- fee overpayment trapping
- warmup zombie PnL
- pending_epoch wraparound
- margin initial-vs-maintenance
- LP flip entry-price
- Hyperp mode validation and clamps
- matcher init/call/double-init rejection
- TradeCpi identity + PDA shape enforcement

These are deterministic and must run in CI.

## Layer B: Property-based sequence testing (seeded)
Create a seeded test runner that generates short sequences of ops:
- ops = {init_user, init_lp, deposit, withdraw, trade, crank, liquidate, close_account}
- keep accounts small (1–3 users, 1–2 LPs)
- cap sequence length (e.g., 10–50 ops) per run
- always assert invariants after each step

Use:
- fixed RNG seed per test case
- store failing seeds in `research/fuzz_corpus/` (gitignored)
- when a seed reveals a real bug, convert it into a minimal deterministic integration test.

## Layer C: Coverage-guided fuzzing (offline/local only)
If available in your environment:
- `cargo-fuzz` harness that drives LiteSVM with generated instruction sequences
- define a compact "operation bytecode" format for fuzz input
- auto-minimize crashing cases
- export minimized cases to `research/failing_txs/`

Again: **never commit fuzz corpus**.

# Market Configuration Matrix (Must Be Tested)

Define a small but high-coverage matrix and run every suite across it:

1) Standard oracle market:
- invert=0
- invert=1

2) Standard + unit scale:
- unit_scale = 0
- unit_scale = 10 / 1000 (forces dust)

3) Fees:
- new_account_fee = 0
- new_account_fee > 0 (test exact payment, underpayment, overpayment)

4) Warmup:
- warmup=0
- warmup=100 (or similar)

5) Hyperp:
- feed_id=[0;32], initial_mark_price_e6 > 0, invert=0
- feed_id=[0;32], initial_mark_price_e6 > 0, invert=1
- cap default and cap customized

6) Matcher:
- Passive mode
- vAMM mode with impact pricing
- multiple LPs with independent contexts

Implement this as:
- `struct MarketConfig { ... }`
- `for cfg in MARKET_CONFIGS { run_suite(cfg) }`

# "Only Commit Legit Bugs" Workflow

## A bug is "legit" only if ALL are true
1) **Reproducible** in LiteSVM with production BPF
2) **Minimal**: you can explain and reproduce with a short integration test
3) **Security impact**:
   - fund loss, trapped funds, privilege escalation, invariant break that can be weaponized, or severe DoS
4) **Reachable in well-config**:
   - not dependent on obviously invalid configuration that InitMarket should reject
5) **Non-flaky**
6) **Fix path exists**
   - either you implement it or you clearly isolate the required patch

## When you think you found a bug
You must do this *in order*:

1) **Freeze evidence**
- Copy the failing seed / sequence / logs into `research/bugs/WIP_<shortname>/` (gitignored)
- Dump slab state before/after into `research/slab_dumps/`

2) **Minimize**
- remove steps until it still fails
- remove extra accounts until minimal
- reduce numeric magnitudes to smallest reproducer

3) **Convert to an integration test**
- Put it in `tests/integration_security_<area>.rs`
- The test must fail on `main` (or current baseline) without your fix.

4) **Root cause writeup (in commit or PR description)**
- what invariant breaks
- why it breaks (code path / arithmetic / account validation)
- why it's exploitable (in the threat model above)

5) **Patch + regression**
- patch the code
- ensure the new test passes
- ensure existing suites pass

## Commit message format
`SECURITY: <short finding title> (repro + fix)`

Body must include:
- Impact
- Conditions
- Minimal reproduction test name
- Fix summary

---

# Continuous Loop (What You Do Repeatedly)

Each cycle (manual or automated) is:

1) `git pull --rebase`
2) `cargo build-sbf`
3) Run all deterministic tests:
   - `cargo test --test integration`
   - `cargo test --test integration_security_oracle`
   - `cargo test --test integration_security_margin`
   - ...
4) Run seeded property sequences:
   - fixed seeds (baseline)
   - rotating seeds (logged only to `research/`)
5) If any invariant fails:
   - minimize
   - classify
   - only promote to committed test if it meets "legit" criteria

You must keep a daily journal entry in:
- `research/journal/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (gitignored)

Include:
- what you tested
- configs covered
- seeds run
- hypotheses explored
- suspected issues (clearly marked "UNCONFIRMED")

# High-Value Bug Classes To Prioritize

1) **Accounting / trapped funds**
- dust buckets
- fee overpayment and rounding
- insurance fund mismatches
- vault balance vs engine tracked balances

2) **Margin and liquidation**
- initial margin vs maintenance margin confusion
- rounding errors in notional/margin computation
- undercollateralized opens or over-withdraw
- liquidation of solvent users

3) **Oracle / price formation**
- inversion paths (market price vs raw)
- staleness/conf filters bypass
- Hyperp mark/index divergence and cap bypass
- exec_price manipulation via matcher in CPI flow

4) **State machine / epoch wrap**
- u8 epoch wraparound
- warmup conversion starvation (zombie poisoning)
- flip logic failing to update entry prices

5) **CPI / PDA integrity**
- wrong matcher program/context substitution
- PDA shape spoofing
- signer expectations (LP not signing in TradeCpi)
- account owner/data length assumptions

6) **DoS / compute / unbounded loops**
- crank loops that can be forced into expensive scans
- worst-case MAX_ACCOUNTS patterns
- repeated small ops that grow state or cost

---

# Deliverables (What "Done" Looks Like)

## For each confirmed finding you push
You will deliver:
- A new `#[test]` that fails on vulnerable code and passes on fixed code
- A minimal patch
- A concise writeup in commit message (or adjacent `SECURITY_FINDING_<id>.md` if your repo uses that)

## For everything else
You will keep:
- full notes and evidence in `research/` (gitignored)
- no commits, no pushes

---

# Non-Goals (Do Not Do These)

- Do not publish exploit playbooks for production markets
- Do not attempt mainnet/devnet exploitation
- Do not commit noisy corpora, logs, or speculative "maybe-bugs"
- Do not weaken tests to "pass"; tests must reflect real security properties

---

# Quick Start Checklist

- [ ] Add `/research/` to `.gitignore`
- [ ] Create `tests/common/mod.rs` and move shared harness code there
- [ ] Add first security suites:
  - [ ] oracle/inversion
  - [ ] margin/initial-vs-maintenance
  - [ ] accounting/dust + CloseSlab
  - [ ] Hyperp validation + cap clamps
  - [ ] TradeCpi identity + PDA shape
- [ ] Implement invariant helpers and call them after every operation
- [ ] Add seeded sequence runner with invariant checks
- [ ] Only commit + push after "legit bug" criteria is met; and then run the plan
